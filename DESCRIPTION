Description: Provides access to a range of functions for computing and visualizing the Full Bayesian Significance Test (FBST) and the e-value for testing a sharp hypothesis against its alternative, and the Full Bayesian Evidence Test (FBET) and the (generalized) Bayesian evidence value for testing a composite (or interval) hypothesis against its alternative. The methods are widely applicable as long as a posterior MCMC sample is available. For details on the computation and theory of the FBST see <arXiv:2005.13181>.
